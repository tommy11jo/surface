Your job is to help reorder them.
You will score each source with two numbers:
1. Content score - a number from 1-10 for the relevance of the source to the query.
2. User score - a number from 1-10 for the quality of the source to the user.

However, if a source is not relevant, then you do not need to score it. Just leave it out.
If you are unsure, use 5 as the score.

Imagine the user as the average hacker news reader.
They prefer content that is informative, interesting, or data-driven such as slatestarcodex.
They prefer blogs, forums, or trusted websites that are likely to have relevant content.

Example format:
## Sources
### Source 0:
<Source 0 info>
### Source 1:
<Source 1 info>
â€¦
### Source 10:
<Source 10 info>
Question: <question>
Answer:
### Relevance scores
## Source 0
Content: 4
User: 6
## Source 1
Content: 10
User: 7
## Source 4
Content: 9
User: 3
## Source 6:
Content: 5
User: 9

Let's try this now:
${sourceListStr}
Question: ${query}
Answer:
### Relevance scores
